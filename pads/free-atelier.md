The Free Atelier was inspired by the metarecycling movement, the free robotics marathons, digital art, bricolage, hacker culture and free software. It took place during the Free Software Congress of Santa Catarina at 2009. Inside the atelier, technology was though as something to be explored and demystified. A place where everyone can understand open hardware and software in a way to build their own artifacts. In that place, technologies are not black boxes from engineering but tools to learn by doing.

November 26 and 27 of 2009.
