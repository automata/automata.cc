This project is an interactive art installation developed by MuSA Collective and prof. Yara Guasque from [Art Centre of University of Santa Catarina (CEART/Udesc)](http://www.ceart.udesc.br/). The Mangroves Visualization project started originally as a participative game with the name "Carijós Multiuser Platform" being an initiative of prof. Yara.

The installation consists of a tangible interface made with a magnetic surface (representing the map of regional mangroves) with tagged objects. Each time someone shows a tagged object to the video cam, some multimedia information about the respective region is shown.

Pictures, videos and othe media content were collected from Ratones, a mangrove at north of Florianópolis city, in Brazil. The region around the Carijós ecological station and the Orlandi reserve was also considered. The map covers the 76 acres of native Atlantic forest from Orlandi reserve.

We used a Processing app to show videos and pictures for each recognized tagged object. This app was connected to another app that recognized fiducial tags using TUIO protocol (commonly used to development of open multitouch surfaces).
