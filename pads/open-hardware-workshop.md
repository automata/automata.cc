This was the first open hardware workshop given by the [MuSA Collective](http://musa.cc) at the Computer Science Department of University of Santa Catarina. The majority of attendants had their first contact with electronics. In 3 days (and late nights) 8 [Arduino Severino](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardSerialSingleSided3) boards were built. 

Some topics were introduced like how basic electronic components work, how to program a microcontroller (the Atmega 128) and how to communicate with the microcontroller using the computer serial port. Both Arduino and Processing language were introduced and some experiments were created.

The presentation created by [@alfakini](http://twitter.com/alfakini) (in pt-br) to the workshop:
