Meemoo is a data flow framework where you connect modules to create amazing apps. Totally powered by the open Web.

> When you think of an "app," do you think of something that you can open, hack, and change how it works? Meemoo wants to give you this freedom. If you can't open it, you don't own it. Meemoo is a framework that connects open-source modules, powered by any web technology. The way that the data flows from module to module is defined and visualized by colorful wires. If you can connect a video player to a TV, you can program a Meemoo app. - Forrest Oliphant

With Meemoo you can create animations and export them as GIFs.
