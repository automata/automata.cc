SIF is Sound Interchange Format
===============================

What is the audio equivalent of GIF?

First of all, what is a GIF or more precisely, an Animated GIF? As described in Wikipedia:

<img src="https://24.media.tumblr.com/ddb6b31434858e534f9c8f2fc8fe9413/tumblr_mqc950m9941rimqm1o1_400.gif" style="float: right; width: 200px" />

> Basic animation was added to the GIF89a spec via the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows various images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays. [...] By default, however, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. [...] Support for  repeating animations first appeared in Netscape Navigator version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers.

In summary, a GIF is a small repeating animation that we *really* love :-)

What should an audio equivalent of GIF be? Well, a small repeating sound file.
