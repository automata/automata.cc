A prototype installation to make us remember old popular songs. Anyone can sing a song (e.g. in the video, some verses of popular Brazilian child songs) and it will be mixed as a track in the composition. The tracks loop forever until someone replace them with other tunes.

Tech.: Puredata, Ubuntu GNU/Linux.
