Tools for Creativity
--------------------

Sometimes I feel like the first Media Labs, as pointed by [Negroponte][1]:

> "The initial founders had one thing in common, and it was really > true for every single person in the Media Lab, they were, to one > degree or another, ostracized by their department. They were 
> considered kind of weird."

I want to create tools that amplifies peoples creativity.

I think we can create an OLPC, XO tablet, Scratch -like experience, but together, collaboratively and physically. I'd love to edit the same Scratch program with others, at the same time, on a white board. I believe the most natural way to do that is using the openness of Web. 

I worked at Meemoo and Mozilla Webmaker, and I believe that there is not a unique solution: everyone has its own language. Every tool has its own paradigm/metaphor. I believe we can create a tool to mix together those metaphors: I want a timeline, so I have one. I want a patch-cord drag-and-drop dataflow, so I have it. I want code as text, so I have it.

In the same way, there isn't just one way to code. I want to code with my body. With markers. With a pen and a paper.

I want to code with ideas. **ifs** and **fors** are so low level. NoFlo is something in this way. Wolfram language too, maybe?

Being a tool in Web make it ok to run on a tablet, a desktop or a raspberry-pi plugged on a TV.

Here is the deal: I know there are *many* applications to Media Lab every year. If I'll not accepted this time, I understand. But I will work the next year on those objectives and I really want to collaborate with you. To make it go to the next level. And the next year I'll apply again, and I will never stop to try because I really want to joy you. You are my dream.

And citing Mr. Negroponte again, "you want to do something impossible? Please come to the Media Lab". OK Media Lab, I'm coming!

- Meemoo remembers a lot the Craft Movement. Meemoo seems to have been built to Craft. Meemoo as a Craft tool. About Craft Movement: http://issuu.com/brunettebru/docs/craft-nova-rede http://issuu.com/brunettebru/docs/tcc_craft-2011

- Another thesis (MIT master!) about craft and coding (algorithm craft): http://web.media.mit.edu/~jacobsj/main.pdf

- Read Dream Machines / Computer Lib b Ted Nelson

- noflo and meemoo as main focus, lots of experiments (AR, augmented programming, virtual reality, dream machines, ...) involved

- a better code editor to mix media (images, diagrams, tables) and to do tabular flow of data, separating model from view. http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/12/tools-conversations-and-cultures.html

- Savannah Niles and her *radio* project: "I’m interested in the capacity of DIY and hacked technology for civic engagement, especially among youth. To me the technology of amateur radio offers an exciting space for alternative STEM education programs and for civic initiatives."

- the superposition between 20th century western subcultures and movements beat/punk/anarco/craft/DIY/freak/maker/hacker/HAM and their influence on our modern life, how to use them to democratize creativity-amp tools
