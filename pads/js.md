Learning JS
===========

Here are my notes on learning and rediscovering JS.

First of all, MDN maintains a really [cool list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) of updated resources to learn JS. Please, check that!

How should I start learning JS?

The short answer: [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide) to a first contact followed by [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

The long answer:

- Start learning the basics of the language reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and/or [The JavaScript Tutorial](http://javascript.info/)
- Study the common Design Patterns reading [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/) and [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
- Study, try, play with some JavaScript frameworks like JQuery, Backbone, React, Polymer, AngularJS, ... and tools like Yoman, Chai, ...
- If you want to go server side (or full-stack), study NodeJS and its frameworks (like Express.js) and tools (like npm, Grunt). A cool entry article is [here](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/21/introduction-to-full-stack-javascript/). NodeJS The Right Way is a good printed book about it.
- Study Web APIs and W3C standards like Web Audio API, WebRTC API, WebSockets, ... MDN is a real good resource on that.
- Learn to use [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) and [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools).
- Learn a JS dialect like [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
- Stay tuned with news and really well-written tutorials on Web APIs and related technology from [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/pt/).
- Sign up news letters like [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/), [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/) and [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/) ([Hackernews Letter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/) is a plus).
- To guys searching for creative coding frameworks, study ThreeJS, D3, PaperJS, ProcessingJS, ... study the OpenGL shaders language!
- Before use jQuery, try vanilla JS! http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/

Complementary:

- Learn about REST and XHR
- Learn about HTML5, CSS3 (and its frameworks/compiler like LESS or Bootstrap) and Web Components
- Study one or more NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Redis, ...
- Study the [HTTP protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) (implement your own simple server in C!) and TCP/UDP sockets
- Learn about those crazy acronyms like JSON, XHR, LESS, XML, XHTML, ... they will always be following you!
