That Monday started raining but warm at University of Santa Catarina. Right at 7pm about 32 guys and gals were together in a lab wanting to answer to the question "what the hell is open hardware?!".

We gave them a brief introduction to physical computing and Arduino. After that everyone built their own Severino board with no previous knowledge of electronics. Around 30 Severino boards were built in that night!
